## About me üôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Hello! I'm Russ, an IT professional with a strong background in DevOps and system administration. I've spent the last 25 years working in various IT roles across multiple industries. I have a deep passion for Linux, open-source systems, automation, and containers. I currently serve as the Practice Manager of SRE & DevOps at [Node4](https://www.node4.co.uk/), managing projects across public and private clouds.

Apart from my work, I have written and contributed to twelve books primarily revolving around container technologies and automation. In my downtime, I enjoy expanding my [vinyl record collection](https://www.mckendrick.rocks/).
